The Golly Pattern folder holds the .rle file to view the TOOBAD Ticker
in the Golly Program.

The Running Ticker folder holds the .html files for the TOOBAD Ticker
with constant generation speeds and canvas sizes. I have also included
a .mp4 file to evidence TOOBAD being generated. I also fixed the small
errors in the word string as evidenced in the video.
Because this program runs slow:
- Please slowly scroll the page vertically and horizontally
- I apologize in advance, but it will take approximately more than half
  an hour for the ticker to produce the first generation of "Golly"
  - Feel free to use the .rle file first to view how the program WILL
    run

The Still Life Canvas folder holds the .html files for the TOOBAD Ticker
with different canvases, allowing users to view how the ticker looks.
